Life's Ledger: The Hectic Day Sim 🏠💼👶
Navigate the beautiful chaos of modern life in London, ON.

Life's Ledger is an engaging web-based simulation game that challenges players to balance the demands of work, family, and personal well-being in a dynamic, ever-changing environment. Experience the daily grind and unexpected curveballs of adult life, making strategic decisions that impact your character's energy, finances, stress, and happiness.

(Initially conceived as "Life's Ledger's," the game's name was playfully rebranded to "My Chaotic Life" by my 9-year-old son, who also served as an enthusiastic QA Tester! His (and my kids') continuous late-night play sessions and feedback were instrumental in transforming the game from a bland, static concept into the interactive, emoji-rich visual experience it is today. We had a blast testing and making continuous improvements together!)

🎮 How to Play
The goal of Life's Ledger is to balance your resources (Energy, Money, Stress, Kid Happiness/Subscribers, Mood, Social Life, and Pet Happiness) while completing daily tasks and reacting to unexpected events.

Key Mechanics:

Character Creation: Start by choosing your name, number of kids (0, 1, or 2), job (Entry-Level Retail Associate, International Student, YouTuber, or Construction Worker), and whether you have a pet (Dog or Cat). Your choices significantly impact your daily challenges and available tasks.

Time Management: Each task consumes a certain amount of in-game time. Choose wisely, as you can't do everything in a single day!

Resource Management:

Energy 🔋: Decreases with tasks, regenerates with rest. If it hits 0, the day ends!

Money 💰: Earned through work, spent on bills and necessities.

Stress 🤯: Increases with demanding tasks and missed responsibilities; decreases with self-care. High stress can lead to breakdowns.

Kid Happiness 😊 / Subscribers ▶️: (Dynamic based on job) Keep your children content or grow your online audience!

Mood 😐: Your emotional state (Happy, Stressed, Bored, Inspired, Overwhelmed) influences how tasks affect your resources.

Social Life 🤝: Maintain connections for overall well-being. It can decay if neglected.

Pet Happiness 🐾: (If applicable) Keep your furry friend happy to avoid chaos!

Daily Tasks: A list of responsibilities appears each day, categorized by type (Work, Family, Self-Care, Chore, Social).

Whims & Opportunities ✨: Smaller, optional tasks that can offer quick boosts or minor challenges.

Emergency Meetings! 🚨 (Random Events): Life throws curveballs! Unexpected events (like surprise bills, internet outages, or pet chaos) will pop up, requiring you to make tough choices with immediate consequences.

Lord Procrastinatus 😈: Beware the inner demon of procrastination, who can temporarily sabotage your tasks!

💡 Original Concept / Genesis
This game was initially created based on the following prompt:

"I want to make a game where you have to balance work, family, and personal well-being. The game should be called 'Life's Ledger'. It should be a single-player, web-based game. The player starts with a certain amount of energy, money, and stress. They have to complete daily tasks like going to work, feeding their kids, doing chores, and taking care of themselves. Each task should take a certain amount of time and affect their energy, money, and stress levels differently. The game should have a clock that progresses through the day. At the end of the day, there should be a summary of how they performed. If energy hits zero, the day ends. Include random events that pop up and require choices from the player, with consequences. Make it a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript game. The setting should be London, Ontario, Canada, and it should reflect current economic challenges (e.g., high cost of living, inflation). The player can choose their job (e.g., retail, international student, YouTuber, construction worker) and the number of kids they have (0, 1, or 2). The game should have a mood system that affects resource changes. For example, if the player is happy, they might gain more energy from resting. If stressed, they might lose more energy from tasks. Include a 'Lord Procrastinatus' event where a task gets sabotaged for a short period. Ensure the game is playable and looks good."
